Cryptocurrency Legitimacy Grading System that uses FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) [Matlab]

The current rules are based on the 5 input data I have. All the combinations for the 5 inputs are not fully covered but has some essential ones like:
- Medium Market Cap & Medium Utility => Moderately Legit
- Low Market Cap & Low Developer Activity => Not Legit
- Low Market Cap & Low Utility => Somewhat Legit
- High Transaction & High Utility => Highly Legit

These are based on some of the ideas I've got from 
- https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-rug-pulls-guide/

Here is the current state of the grading system which does not include everything but somehow gives moderately legit grading :)

After the last update on the rules, this is the new output

• Bitcoin (BTC) holds the highest legitimacy rating, signifying a robust position in terms of 
market confidence and expected long-term viability.
• Ethereum (ETH) maintains a relatively high rating because to its substantial developer 
engagement and practicality, even if it encounters competition from newly developing 
cryptocurrencies.
• Tether (USDT), a commonly utilized stablecoin, possesses a rating that indicates a favourable 
equilibrium between market adoption and operational reliability.
• Binance USD (BUSD) and NEO have lower legitimacy ratings, indicating possible areas for 
enhancement or reduced market trust in comparison to the top cryptocurrencies.
• XRP and Solana (SOL) are assigned similar grades, indicating equivalent degrees of 
legitimacy based on the parameters established by the FIS.
